# Prepo

[Current State](#current-state)

[TODO](#todo)

Prepo stops you from getting street sweeping parking tickets. It's built off the laravel framework. In active development.

## Current State
Shows you a map. When you click it, a marker plots on it and tells you the street sweeping rules

## TODO

- ~~build parser to fill schedule database with actual data from http://archive.sandiego.gov/stormwater/pdf/district3schedule.pdf~~
- avenues and some other street types don't work yet. Streets and Drives definitely should.
- add button to show current location
- detect whether the current time is during the street sweeping window
- display all bad parking zones for a given time
- expand beyond north park
